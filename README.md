# Crop Yield Predictions

## 🌟 Overview

Crop yield prediction is a critical challenge in agriculture. Accurate crop yield forecasts can:
- Address global food security challenges.
- Mitigate the impacts of climate change.
- Support effective agricultural risk management.

This project leverages supervised machine learning techniques to predict crop yields using various factors, such as weather conditions (rainfall, temperature), pesticide usage, and historical crop yield data.
